# Sensor Aggregation Simulation
Sensor Aggregation Simulation is an app to show graphs of statics data min, max, median, and avg from sensorsâ€™ values (temperature, humidity) by room.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
What things do you need to install the software and how to install them
1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. If you are in windows, there is a chance to get an error because of the execution policy. If you get the error, run this program as an administrator
```console
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
### Installation
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ali-aiar/Sensor-Aggregation-Simulation.git
```
2. Create a virtual environment 
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux or macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```
4. Install the required packages by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the program by executing the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
6. To deactivate the virtual environment, run:
```bash
deactivate
```
## Running the tests
To run the test you must be in the ./ directory. 
### Test the models
The test will use unittest library, to know if the model working as intended and generating random values by giving room id.
```bash
python -m unittest ./tests/test_models.py
```
